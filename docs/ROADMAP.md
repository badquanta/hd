# Roadmap

Currently we are at v0.0.1

By version:

- v1.0.0: Public RFC / Release
  - Basics of Quake-like game framework.
  @todo refine better as we go from above sentence.
- (...) @todo lots of steps between v1.0.0 & v0.1.0

- v0.1.0: Private RFC / Release
  - Bare bones 3d scene rendering
    * maybe with lighting
  - Bare bones application user interface for tooling & debug.
- v0.0.2: Immediate goals
  - Remove event handling from `sdl::Window`
- v0.0.1: Where I'm at right now; pre-releasing anything.
  - prototype engine framework: Singleton + framework main loop.
  - sdl window, surface & font are well abstracted by smart pointer memory handlers.
  - initial prototyping of user interface components
